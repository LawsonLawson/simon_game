# 🟢🔴🟡🔵 Simon Game

A classic **memory challenge game** built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
Test your memory skills by repeating an ever-growing sequence of colors and sounds. Each level adds a new color to the sequence — how far can you go before making a mistake?

## 🎮 Gameplay Overview

The **Simon Game** is simple yet challenging.  
Here’s how it works:

1. The game flashes a **random color** (and plays a tone).  
2. You must **click the same color**.  
3. The game then repeats the pattern but **adds one new random color**.  
4. You must remember and repeat the **entire sequence**.  
5. The sequence keeps growing until you make a mistake — then, it’s **Game Over!**

## 🧠 Example

| Round | Sequence Shown | What You Should Press |
|-------|----------------|-----------------------|
| 1     |🟢              |🟢                     |
| 2     |🟢 🔴           |🟢 🔴                  |
| 3     |🟢 🔴 🟡        |🟢 🔴 🟡               |
| 4     |🟢 🔴 🟡 🔵     |🟢 🔴 🟡 🔵            |

If you happen to fumble the pattern by even one color, the game ends.
